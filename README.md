# Source Memory Monitoring with TV viewing

# Summary
Participants view a series (7 videos) of television advertisements followed by a series (7 videos) of TV programme clips. 7+7 video clips = 14 clips (1 block), 10 blocks overall (70 video clips). Half of the advertisemetns (experimental blocks) in the study (35 ad/programme pais) are conceptually linked, that is, the advertised objects appear conceptually somewhere in the within-block programmes (outside of the main scene focus). The other half contains ad/programme inter-block video clips that contain no conceptual link (control blocks).

We assess participant memory (the source monitoring part) 24 hours later using final stills from each advertisement. This part comprises images (final image stills) from the end of the conceptually linked advertisements (viewed the day before), the non-conceptually linked advertisements (also viewed before), and foils (that the participant had never seen). 

Will upload more detailed information on video lags, and the source monitoring (next day memory measure) paradigm soon.
